# Handy Adobe Illustrator scripts

I'll be adding random AI scripts here that might be handy for some people. Keep in mind that I'm not really a programmer, so this stuff will be hacky as hell at best :)

## Installing instructions

You can run scripts from Illustrator by going to _File -> Scripts -> Other Script..._ menu and selecting the script on the file system. 

But if you're using the same script often enough, it might be a good idea to add it to the Scripts menu. To do that, change the file extension to **.jsx** and copy it to the _Illustrator CC/Presets/Scripts_ folder in your Illustrator CC installation directory. The script's filename, minus the file extension, appears in the Scripts menu.
